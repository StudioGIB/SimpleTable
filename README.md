# About SimpleTable
Simple table is a short project, born from the playful idea to make a table out of a single piece of wood (e.g. plywood) wasting as less material as possible and using the least numbers of cuts. Keep it simple and cheap.

The standard size will be 70 x 85 cm 
infos and drawings will be provided to allow people to use both cnc and traditional milling



# Open Source Design - Fabrication 
We work on experimental design fueled by public support.
We strongly believe in a new way of doing Architecture, one in which we share with you the process and the results of our research, designs and builds.
All of GIB's projects are open-source. That is, during the development of any one project, all the content is hosted publicly on Github. We are also available via chat rooms on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Qf9EzJqV9).

As we're mostly self-sustained, in order to keep our research free and running, we're on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/StudioGIB) too, where you can support us with your contribute.

# Ethos
The idea behind open sourced furniture is that anyone could take the "recipe" and build it locally.
It cutting down the costs of transport, packaging and delivery, reducing considerably the carbon footprint of the process.
In addition to ecological reasons, to build locally means redirecting work toward local craftsmans, thus an healtier economy.
Choice of wood:
Plywood (birch) is already a pretty good material, ecologically-wise, but we suggest buying FSC plywood (sourced on sustainably managed forests).
